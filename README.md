# CatanNEAT
Entirely in Processing JS, these are the beginnings to a Settlers of Catan NEAT algorithm.
The hexagon section is for creating the game tiles, which I ultimately copied into the base program,
basicCatan, which has the game rules as well. Or will.
No rules have been implemented yet, but they and players are on their way
